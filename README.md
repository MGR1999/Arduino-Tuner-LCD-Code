# Arduino Tuner LCD Code

This code was originally created for the Multi-Effects Pedal project, as a part of the EECS Capstone class at Oregon State University.
This class ran from Fall 2021 to Spring 2022. The arduino tuner was only a small part of the overall Multi-Effects Pedal system, for further information
